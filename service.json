        "description": "Get to know the staff at your local Fresh Fish Place. Be pleasant and ask questions. Your interest will be rewarded with valuable pieces of information that helps you prepare, cook and learn more about the fresh fish on offer at the shops. Learn what fresh seafood looks like. Fish should be bright, shiny and firm. Certain species, for example Mackerel, even raise their pectoral fins when they are extremely fresh. It is as if the fish is signalling, “Hey, I am fresh — yes, over here”.Surprisingly, many fish also show small sgns of their freshness. Super fresh sea bass often has beautifully spiky dorsal fins stretched out, whilst the sardines still have their bellies tight and firm.The quickest and most enjoyable way to learn about seafood is to buy the whole fish. Handling seafood is a great way to learn and understand what you want to cook. Watch cooking shows on television, read articles online, buy magazines and cookbooks. Buy fresh fish and experiment. Visit your The Fresh Fish Place regularly to ask questions and listen to conversations between your fishmonger and other customers. Never stop learning. Learn something new about buying seafood every time you visit The Fresh Fish Place."
